# Vue Boilerplates : vue-typescript-bootstrap-boilerplate

> A vue.js project with Latest Vue + Typescript + Bootstrap + Lazy loading and code splitting

## Why to choose Vue Boilerplates?
> While mobile-first approach becomes a standard and uncertain network conditions are something we should always take into consideration, it’s harder and harder to keep your application loading fast. Hence **Vue Boilerplates** are built with vue.js performance optimization techniques that make them loading instantly and perform smooth :rocket:.
